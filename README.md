# TSPTW
A TSPTW algorithm made in a Centrale Supelec course.
Inside the folder code you can find:
On the livrable a rapport about what we did at the end of the course

And a set of function to use simulated annealing on the salesman problems with time windows.
Just run main to set up some benchmark.
The other functions are used in this orders:
classes creates instance of the problems and instance of solution
simulated k annealing uses K-OPT to do simulated annealing,
desscore shows some examples of score that we can use
plot show how the solutions behaves as the algorithms goes on 
rendu pour entretien show some examples of plots 

I strongly recommend you to see others algorithms online which are not simulated annealing and to optimize the score function. It may takes a few minutes to run
